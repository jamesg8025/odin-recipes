# odin-recipes
This recipes project is to put into use the recently-acquired skills of HTML basics.
In this project, different recipes will be implemented by the usage of tags such as ordered and unordered lists, together with the use of different headings to differentiate the different stages within a recipe - all wrapped within a basic HTML doctype.
